A protocol to enable `UIViewController`s or `UIView`s to present placeholder views based on content, loading, error or empty states.

![StatefulViewController Example](Resources/example.gif)

## Overview

In a networked application a view controller or custom view typically has the following states that need to be communicated to the user:

* **Loading**: The content is currently being loaded over the network.
* **Content**: The content is available and presented to the user.
* **Empty**: There is currently no content available to display.
* **Error**: An error occurred whilst downloading content.

As trivial as this flow may sound, there are a lot of cases that result in a rather large decision tree.

![Decision Tree](Resources/decision_tree.png)

`StatefulViewController` is a concrete implementation of this particular decision tree. (If you want to create your own modified version, you might be interested in the [state machine](#viewstatemachine) that is used to show and hide views.)

## Usage

> This guide describes the use of the `StatefulViewController` protocol on `UIViewController`. However, you can also adopt the `StatefulViewController` protocol on any `UIViewController` subclass, such as `UITableViewController` or `UICollectionViewController`, as well as your custom `UIView` subclasses.

First, make sure your view controller adopts to the `StatefulViewController` protocol.

```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController, StatefulViewController {
    // ...
}
```

Then, configure the `loadingView`, `emptyView` and `errorView` properties (provided by the `StatefulViewController` protocol) in `viewDidLoad`.

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    // Setup placeholder views
    loadingView = // UIView
    emptyView = // UIView
    errorView = // UIView
}
```

In addition, call the `setupInitialViewState()` method in `viewWillAppear:` in order to setup the initial state of the controller.

```swift
override func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {
    super.viewWillAppear(animated)

    setupInitialViewState()
}
```

After that, simply tell the view controller whenever content is loading and `StatefulViewController` will take care of showing and hiding the correct loading, error and empty view for you.

```swift
override func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {
    super.viewWillAppear(animated)

    setupInitialViewState()
    loadDeliciousWines()
}

func loadDeliciousWines() {
    startLoading()

    let url = NSURL(string: "http://example.com/api")
    let session = NSURLSession.sharedSession()
    session.dataTaskWithURL(url) { (let data, let response, let error) in
        endLoading(error: error)
    }.resume()
}
```

### Set custom delays
To minimize a flickering effect between transitions from and to the loading view, `StatefulViewController` delays between these transitions. If `endLoading` is faster than the delay before the loading view is shown, the loading view will be skipped and content is shown. On the other hand if the loading view is shown (the delay has finished), another delay is set before the content is shown. The default values of both delays are 1 second, but they can also be customized, by implementing the following methods:

```swift
func toLoadingTransitionDelay() -> Double {
    return 0.7
}

func fromLoadingTransitionDelay() -> Double {
    return 1.2
}
```

### Life cycle

StatefulViewController calls the `hasContent` method to check if there is any content to display. If you do not override this method in your own class, `StatefulViewController` will always assume that there is content to display.

```swift
func hasContent() -> Bool {
    return datasourceArray.count > 0
}
```

Optionally, you might also be interested to respond to an error even if content is already shown. `StatefulViewController` will not show its `errorView` in this case, because there is already content that can be shown.

To e.g. show a custom alert or other unobtrusive error message, use `handleErrorWhenContentAvailable:` to manually present the error to the user.

```swift
func handleErrorWhenContentAvailable(error: ErrorType) {
    let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Ooops", message: "Something went wrong.", preferredStyle: .Alert)
    alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .Default, handler: nil))
    presentViewController(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```



### Custom Placeholder View insets

Per default, StatefulViewController presents all configured placeholder views fullscreen (i.e. with 0 insets from top, bottom, left & right from the superview). In case a placeholder view should have custom insets the configured placeholderview may conform to the `StatefulPlaceholderView` protocol and override the `placeholderViewInsets` method to return custom edge insets.

```swift
class MyPlaceholderView: UIView, StatefulPlaceholderView {
    func placeholderViewInsets() -> UIEdgeInsets {
        return UIEdgeInsets(top: 20, left: 20, bottom: 20, right: 20)
    }
}
```

### View State Machine

> Note: The following section is only intended for those, who want to create a stateful controller that differs from the flow described above.

You can also use the underlying view state machine to create a similar implementation for your custom flow of showing/hiding views.

```swift
let stateMachine = ViewStateMachine(view: view)

// Add states
stateMachine["loading"] = loadingView
stateMachine["other"] = otherView

// Transition to state
stateMachine.transitionToState(.View("loading"), animated: true) {
    println("finished switching to loading view")
}

// Hide all views
stateMachine.transitionToState(.None, animated: true) {
    println("all views hidden now")
}
```

## Installation

#### Swift Package Manager

TODO: add instructions for SPM

#### Manually

Just drag and drop the two `.swift` files in the `StatefulViewController` folder into your project.

## Tests

Open the Xcode project and press `âŒ˜-U` to run the tests.

Alternatively, all tests can be run from the terminal using [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool).

```bash
xctool -scheme StatefulViewControllerTests -sdk iphonesimulator test
```
